- [x]Here is the whole conversation taken from reddit.'Hello there, I'm sorry for the late repy but this is how I fix the audio distortion.
 1 Download or Clone the ComboJack repository from this link https://github.com/hackintosh-stuff/ComboJack
 2 put ComboJack_Installer/VerbStub.kext in OC/Kexts
 3 Make sure to add the kext into your config.plist (I used ProperTree because I only need to screenshot my OC folder using Ctrl+R or Command+R in Mac)
 4 Run ComboJack_Installer/install.sh in terminal and reboot
 5 Done. Whenever you attach a device through the jack there will be a popup (like this) asking about the device type.' 

- [x] USB-C
